A Very Merry Christmas to you, ${GIVE_NAME}! This is the Super Santa Bot!

I'm here to tell you that you have the Super Secret opportunity to get someone a Super Spectacular present! I have personally selected someone Super Special for you <3 (and didn't even tell Jess about it, I promise!)

Okay, get ready...


Your Super Secret someone is...

DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN! (Cue Legend of Zelda treasure chest soundbyte)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!! ${REC_NAME} !!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YAYAY! I hope you got someone cool. Personally, I think they're pretty great!

And now, for the important stuff:

*** DA RULES ***
- Get your Secret Someone something special
- Sappy, silly and sneaky gifts are 100% welcome
- If you're stuck, almost everyone loves chocolate
- AND ABOVE ALL!
- Make sure your gift is filled with love, Christmas cheer, and under (or approximately) $25.00 CAD

And just in case the pressure is getting to you, here are some wise words from our beloved friend, Mr. Grinch:

"Maybe Christmas", he thought, "doesn't come from a store. Maybe Christmas... Perhaps... Means a little bit more."

Soooo, if your gift for ${REC_NAME} turns out to be a little less-than-absolutely-wonderfully-perfect (and/or the gift you receive turns out to be a little less-than-absolutely-wonderfully-perfect), think back to Mr. Grinch's wise wordsâ€”and remember the true Reason for the season :)

Alright! Thanks for bearing with the Super Santa Bot :-), Merriest of Merry Christmases, and can't wait to spend this special season (physically-distanced or not) with all of you!

Peace & love,
