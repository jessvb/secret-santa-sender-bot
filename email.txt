Yoooo ${GIVE_NAME}! This is the Super Santa Bot! I've got KFC in my belly, and present-givers on my list!

MERRY CHRISTMAS!

I'm here to tell you that you have the Super Secret opportunity to get someone a Super Spectacular present! I have personally selected someone Super Special for you <3 (and didn't even tell jess about it, I promise ;);) )

Okay, get ready...


Your Super Secret someone is...

DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN! (Cue Legend of Zelda treasure chest soundbyte)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!! ${REC_NAME} !!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YAYAY! I hope you got someone cool. Personally, I love that person a lot <3 (or at the very least, I'm pretty sure I will, once I get to know them!) 

And now, for the important stuff:

*** DA RULES ***
- Get your Secret Someone something special
- Sappy things are great
- Silly things are great
- Sneaky things are great
- BUT ABOVE ALL!
- Make sure it's filled with KFC-- I mean, love <3 and under (or approximately) $30.00 USD
(I may or may not have chosen this number arbitrarily... By the power invested in me, the author of this algorithm, I choose you, $30USD!)

And just in case the pressure is getting to you, here are some wise words from our beloved friend, Mr. Grinch:

"Maybe Christmas", he thought, "doesn't come from a store. Maybe Christmas... Perhaps... Means a little bit more."

Soooo, if you don't get ${REC_NAME} the most fantastically fantastic, wonderfully wonderous gift ever, I guessssss they might just still be okay with that, and might just still consider keeping you around until next year ;) 


Alright! Thanks for bearing with the Super Santa Bot :-) and Merriest of Merry Christmases!

Peace.
